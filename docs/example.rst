Monophonic resampling
=====================

The following code block demonstrates how to resample an audio signal.

We use `librosa <https://librosa.org/>`_ for loading the audio,
but this is purely for ease of demonstration.  `resampy` does not depend on `librosa`.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import librosa
    import resampy

    # Load in librosa's example audio file at its native sampling rate
    x, sr_orig = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet'), sr=None)

    # x is now a 1-d numpy array, with `sr_orig` audio samples per second

    # We can resample this to any sampling rate we like, say 16000 Hz
    y_low = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, 16000)

    # That's it!


Stereo and multi-dimensional data
=================================

The previous example operates on monophonic signals, but resampy also supports stereo
resampling, as demonstrated below.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import librosa
    import resampy

    # Load in librosa's example audio file at its native sampling rate.
    # This time, also disable the stereo->mono downmixing
    x, sr_orig = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet', hq=True), sr=None, mono=False)

    # x is now a 2-d numpy array, with `sr_orig` audio samples per second
    # The first dimension of x indexes the channels, the second dimension indexes
    # samples.
    # x[0] is the left channel, x[1] is the right channel.

    # We can again resample.  By default, resample assumes the last index is time.
    y_low = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, 16000)

    # To be more explicit, provide a target axis
    y_low = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, 16000, axis=1)


The next block illustrates resampling along an arbitrary dimension.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import numpy as np
    import resampy

    # Generate 4-dimensional white noise.  The third axis (axis=2) will index time.
    sr_orig = 22050
    x = np.random.randn(10, 3, sr_orig * 5, 2)

    # x is now a 10-by-3-by-(5*22050)-by-2 tensor of data.

    # We can resample along the time axis as follows
    y_low = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, 11025, axis=2)

    # y_low is now a 10-by-3-(5*11025)-by-2 tensor of data

Integer-valued samples
======================
Integer-valued inputs are supported, but because resampy interpolates between
sample values, it will always produce a floating-point output.
If you really need integer-valued outputs after resampling, you'll have to cast the
output array as demonstrated below.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    import numpy as np
    import resampy

    sr_orig = 22050

    # Create 5 seconds of random integer noise
    x = np.random.randint(-32768, high=32767, size=5*sr_orig, dtype=np.int16)

    # resample, y will be floating-point type
    y = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, 11025)

    # Cast back to match x's dtype
    y_int = y.astype(x.dtype)


Advanced filtering
==================
resampy allows you to control the design of the filters used in resampling operations.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import numpy as np
    import scipy.signal
    import librosa
    import resampy

    # Load in some audio
    x, sr_orig = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet'), sr=None, mono=False)

    # Resample to 22050Hz using a Hann-windowed sinc-filter
    y = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, sr_new, filter='sinc_window', window=scipy.signal.windows.hann)

    # Or a shorter sinc-filter than the default (num_zeros=64)
    y = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, sr_new, filter='sinc_window', num_zeros=32)

    # Or use the pre-built high-quality filter
    y = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, sr_new, filter='kaiser_best')

    # Or use the pre-built fast filter
    y = resampy.resample(x, sr_orig, sr_new, filter='kaiser_fast')
